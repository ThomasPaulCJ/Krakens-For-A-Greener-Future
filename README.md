## Introduction
The **Krakens For A Greener Future** project is a collection of interactive mini-games developed to raise awareness of critical environmental issues. Each game is designed to reflect specific challenges and solutions tied to sustainable development goals. The project aims to engage users, educate them on pressing environmental issues, and encourage small actions that can lead to big changes.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage with mini-games that simulate real-world environmental challenges.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through game-based learning.
- **AI and Data Integration**: Explore innovative approaches to environmental data and sustainability efforts.
- **Sustainability Awareness**: Increase awareness of climate action, marine life conservation, and terrestrial biodiversity.

## Games and Controls
Here is a breakdown of the games included in this project and how to interact with them:

### SDG 13: Climate Action
**Objective**: Help reduce harmful gas emissions by popping red (toxic) gas bubbles, while avoiding green (O2) bubbles that represent clean oxygen.

- **How to Play**:
  - Use the **mouse left-click** to pop the red bubble gases that appear on the screen.
  - Be careful not to pop the green (O2) bubbles. Popping a green bubble will **deduct 1 point** from your score, as oxygen is essential for the environment.
  - Your goal is to maximize your score by popping as many red bubbles as possible while avoiding the green ones.

- **Real-World Connection**: This game simulates the challenge of reducing harmful emissions and protecting essential elements like oxygen in our atmosphere. It underscores the importance of managing industrial emissions while safeguarding natural resources.

### SDG 14: Life Below Water
**Objective**: Explore the ocean by moving a submarine, symbolizing the importance of underwater ecosystems.

- **How to Play**:
  - Use the **arrow keys** on your keyboard to move the submarine up, down, left, and right.
  - Your objective is to navigate the submarine freely in the water.

- **Real-World Connection**: This game reflects the importance of marine conservation and the need for exploration and protection of the ocean's delicate ecosystems.

### SDG 15: Life on Land
**Objective**: Help clean up terrestrial environments by collecting falling waste using a dustbin.

- **How to Play**:
  - Use the **right and left arrow keys** to move the dustbin across the screen.
  - Position the dustbin to catch falling pieces of waste before they hit the ground.
  - The more waste you collect, the cleaner the environment becomes, helping to preserve land ecosystems.

- **Real-World Connection**: This game mirrors the global challenge of managing waste and protecting land ecosystems from pollution. By collecting and managing waste, we can prevent further damage to our forests, wildlife habitats, and natural resources.
